# ðŸš— AI-Powered Blind Spot Detection System for Foggy and Rainy Conditions

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
This project simulates an AI-driven **Blind Spot Detection System** designed for vehicles operating in **low-visibility environments** like fog and rain. It focuses on:
- **Object Detection in Adverse Weather**
- **Risk Assessment and Adaptive Decision Making**

The goal is to enhance **vehicle safety** by integrating AI, sensor fusion, and machine learning for real-time detection and warnings.
