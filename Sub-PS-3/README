AI-Based Object Detection in Foggy and Rainy Conditions
🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-based object detection system that works reliably in challenging weather conditions like fog, rain, and low visibility. The goal is to enhance road safety by improving detection accuracy during adverse weather, where traditional methods often fail.

📌 Problem Statement
Visibility on roads decreases drastically during foggy or rainy conditions, leading to challenges in object detection for autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems.

Our AI system is designed to: ✅ Detect objects like vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs
✅ Perform better under synthetic fog, blurring, and low contrast
✅ Enhance images using AI-based preprocessing for clearer detection

🗂 Dataset & Augmentation
📚 Datasets Used
BDD100K - General driving dataset

Foggy Cityscapes - Dataset with synthetic fog

🛠 Data Augmentation Techniques
Synthetic Fog Addition

Blurring
